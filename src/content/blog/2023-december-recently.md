## ü™¥ Life

It's my birthday month, I turned 24! I also had my last exam at the start of the month, it went great. After the examperiod was over I moved back home from Bergen since I'm going to Valencia in Spain next semester as an exchange student! I'm so hyped, can't wait to live in Spain for 6 months, VAMOS!

Christmas was nice, have been good to see old friends back home. New Years was awesome as always, I LOVE fireworks!üéÜ
