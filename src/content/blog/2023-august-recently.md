## 🪴 Life

This month I finished my internship at [NAV IT](https://detsomebetyrnoe.no) which was superfun, and I've learned so much from it!

I also started my last year of university! This semester I'm gonna have courses about [Machine Learning Engineering and Advanced Algorithms](https://www.hvl.no/en/studies-at-hvl/study-programmes/courses/DAT158), [Systems Thinking and Innovation for Engineers](https://www.hvl.no/studier/studieprogram/emne/ING303) and [Work placement, ICT](https://www.hvl.no/en/studies-at-hvl/study-programmes/courses/DAT156) at [WA.works](https://wa.works/) here in Bergen!

## ✍️ Blogging

I finished my blog-post about my [internship at NAV IT](/blog/nav23) this summer, which was a loooong post! It's in norwegian unfortunately, but maybe I'll translate it some time in the future.

> ***Sidenote:** Very happy that I've managed to have journaled for 4 months in a row now!*

## 💪 Health

Been good getting back into my training routines! I've started doing strength training on mondays and thursdays, climbing tuesdays and in the weekends, as well as swimming during wednesdays!

So far I've managed to keep up the routine, but if it doesn't work in the long term I've got to change it up a bit.  

I've also started a training diary, which helps me remember what weights I've used, and is also a great motivation to keep going to the gym!

## 👨‍💻Development

During my internship I've learned a lot of new technologies, like Kotlin, Typescript, Cypress and so on!

The Astro rewrite of my website is going good, love this little sideproject!

Btw I installed Arch on my laptop!! Super cool experience, and I've learned a lot from it. It's working, but not everything is in place lol. Here is a [repo](https://github.com/SindreKjelsrud/dotfiles) for my dotfiles btw!

## 📚 Reading

- Bought the entire collection of [Summit Of The Gods](https://www.ark.no/produkt/boker/skjonnlitteratur/summit-of-the-gods-vol1-9788496427877) manga. Can't wait to read them during christmas!

## 🎬 Entertainment

### Movies

- *Arrival*: Loved it! I have no clue why I watched it so late after it's release.
- *How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days*: Saw it with my mom, very funny movie!
- *Transformers: Rise of the Beasts*: Loved it, but I'm biased when it comes to Transformers lol. It has a special place in my heart lmao.
- *Lost in Translation*: Didn't understand it that much tbh..
- *Jobs*: Cool to watch after reading the book, a lot of stuff I remembered!

### TV

- *Dragon Ball*: Finally after 4 years I've finished it! Got more exciting towards the end, and maybe I'll continue the series.
