## 🪴 Life

This month have gone by super fast! A lot of stuff has happened, I've been on three trips to Sweden, gone to the cinema, done a lot of socialing after work and so on.

The social happenings after work have been a lot of fun! There have been a lot of eating at Oslo Street Food and fun activities such as dart, pool, arcade-machines, bowling and so on!

One of the trips to Sweden was to Gothenburg where me and a friend saw one of Coldplays concerts! It was such an amazing experience, and soooo cool to watch the lightshow aswell.

The other two trips to Sweden was to my familys summerhouse, one with some friends and the other with my family and girlfriend. Two very nice trips!

## 💪 Health

During the summer my training-routine crumbled up a bit for some reason I don't know, but I've gotten some training done even though it's less than I want.

On the brighter side I tried out padel for the first time and it's so fun!! Can't wait to play more in the future.

I've also, during the last half of the month, gone bouldering after work with a colleague which have been fun!

## 👨‍💻Development

This month has gone by super fast, and I've learned so much at the internship! I can't wait to start working after my bachelor now, it's so fun.

Also this month I've started using [Gitmojis](https://gitmoji.dev/) for my commits! I like it a lot even though it doesn't necessarily provide any functionality other than being cool lol.

I've started my Astro rebuilding process for my website, it's going slow but enjoying the process! Working on it under the *astro-rewrite* branch on the repo if you want to take a look.

## 📚 Reading

- Bought and finished *The Art of War* by Sun Tzu in a day. A cool book to read about military strategy and tactics, where it shows you how to become an effective leader, gain advantage in your market, understand your competitors and more!

## 🎬 Entertainment

### Movies

- *Bridget Jones's Baby*: Watched it with my grandma, pretty funny! I think the trilogy of Bridget Jones is pretty good lol.
- *Divergent*: Cool movie, like the concept. I don't know why it took so many years before I watched it.
- *Insurgent*: Liked it, but don't know if I liked it more than the first. Good sequel though!
- *Blade Runner 2049*: Super cool sci-fi with hypnotic cinematography! Haven't watched the original, but it sure is on my watchlist now!
- *Oppenheimer*: One word: wow.

### TV

- *Vinland Saga*: Finished season 2, it was sooo good! Watched the whole season with a friend.
- *Demon Slayer*: Finished season 3, what a finale! 
- *Formula 1: Drive to Survive*: Finished season 5, it was aight. Most of it I watched during training, liked the ending with Riccardio!

## 🎧 Music

I got my freaking *Minecraft - Volume Alpha* vinyl this month!! It's my absolute favorite, no other vinyl will beat it lol. Its so good!
