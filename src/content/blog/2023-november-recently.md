## ü™¥ Life

Tons of stuff has happened this month! [friByte](https://fribyte.no) hosted [Bergen Open Source conference](https://boskonf.no) and it was a success!! I was one of those in charge of planning the conference and I'm so happy with the outcome after all the work I put in, can't wait for the one next year (hopefully).

I was a lot outside this month as well. I slept outside on top of Fl√∏yen and went outside bouldering for my first time, it was sick! (more about it under [üí™ Health](#üí™-health))

This month was filled up with school as well since it's the examperiod.. My work placement at Wide Assessment finished, and as of today (1.12.23) I finished my last exam of 2023! Can't wait for the holidays!!

## üí™ Health

This month I've been active outdoors and went bouldering alot! I actually went bouldering outside for my first time, it was so fun!! There was a huge field of stones in the woods near √Öseb√∏, called [Perleveggen](https://buldring.bergen-klatreklubb.no/sector/3526). The boulder was named [***Time for a haircut***](https://buldring.bergen-klatreklubb.no/problem/16336) and it was a 6A! It took some tries and I must say, bouldering outside is something else lol.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technology

I've renamed the development-section to  technology since then I can include more stuff, like how I bought my first server this month! It's an old PC, the ***HP Prodesk 600 G3 SFF I7***. Bought some more RAM for it and are planning to set it up in December! I got inspired by [Rolf](https://github.com/polsevev) to learn myself Kubernetes, so that's my plan. 

## üìö Reading

- *Mob Psycho 100: Vol. 8:* Pretty good, loved Mob's little journey. Cool backstory on Mogami!

## üé¨ Entertainment

### Movies

- *The Little Mermaid (liveaction):* Liked it, but animation is better hehe.
- *Barbie:* Saw this in the cinema with my girlfriend and jesus christ this was funny as well as thought provoking! The meta humor was on point. 5/5 easy.
- *Gemini Man:* Cool action movie! 
- *El Camino:* This was such a good movie to finish of Jesses character. Loved it so much.
- *The Hunger Games:* Not exactly what I expected, but it was cool! Took me some years to see it hehe.

### TV

- *Attack on Titan: Final Season:* The end of an era! Such a good ending, wow.
- *Breaking Bad S01-S05:* Binged BB for the whole october and november hehe. I've never seen the whole series, just episodes here and there. Loved it!
