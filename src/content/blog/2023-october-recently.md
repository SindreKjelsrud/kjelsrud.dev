## 🪴 Life

October's gone by slow ahahh! This month I've done a little bit of everything, I was at a mutton cabbage dinner with some friends, ran [rosa sløyfe løpet](https://www.rosasloyfelopet.no/bergen/), did the monthly bath in the sea, went to a housewarming party, finished setting up my first sportsclimbing route (picture under [💪Health](#💪-health)) and went to Stavanger for a birthday party.

## ✍️ Blogging

Been getting some more ideas and started writing some new posts! Many in the backlog now hehe..

## 💪 Health

I haven't been so good this month following my training routing, but I've managed getting some training in! Been a lot of stuff to do, so I've not prioritized training as much.

As promised here is my first selfmade sportsclimbing route, I proudly present ***teknobamsane***! It was super fun to make and hope I'll create more in the future. 

> PS: we graded it 7- with the consideration of the other grades given in the hall, so maybe it's a bit higher than it should lol..

## 🎬 Entertainment

### Movies

- *Tetris:* This movie was a masterpiece! I knew the story behind Tetris from before, but wow what a movie still.
- *Moneyball:* Supercool movie, Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill is such a good duo!
- *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3:* Emotional rollercoaster of a movie, I loved it!
- *Mr. & Mrs. Smith:* Seen it before, but a long time ago. Pretty good!

### TV

The 15. of October 2023 is the day I reached episode 1000 of One Piece., this is a day to remember. Peak television, no other words to describe this.

- *Sex Education S4:* Had to watch it since I've watched the other seasons, I liked it!

## 🎧 Music

I bought [Ramóns'](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5r6ViSL3nacDRVBtnXlixL) *"SÅ KLART DET GJØR VONDT"* vinyl. Can't wait to hear it when I get home for christmas!
