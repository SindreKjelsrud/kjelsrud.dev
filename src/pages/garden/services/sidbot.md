## 📝 Info

This is a Discord bot made by me with JavaScript. I made it originally in Python, but there were some talk about the *discord.py* library getting shut down so I switched. Here's the source code: [GitHub link](https://github.com/SindreKjelsrud/sidBot)

## 👷 Installation

When cloning the repository for the first time, you must run an ***npm install*** to download the correct dependencies.

## 🔨 bot.sh - Script

This script is designed to launch the bot as quickly as possible on the server (not the longest script but saves a few seconds lol).

`cd sidBot-js/ && node .`

## 💡 TODO()

- [ ] Fix Github Actions so it r’syncs to my server on updates.
- [ ] An auto welcome message for new users on the server
- [ ] !Xquote - Bot sends quotes from breaking bad, star wars etc.
- [ ] !ascii {text} - Bot sends text in ascii-form
- [ ] !rps - Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- [ ] !poll - Bot lets user create a poll with emojis which indicates options
- [ ] !movie - Bot sends a movie recommendation from a movie database
- [ ] !trivia - Bot sends a random trivia question both with and without multiple choice answers
- [ ] !stats - Bot sends a statistic for the discord server, like total servermembers, bots and online members
