## 📝 Info

Kanto was an old MacBook Air I had lying around. Since joining [friByte](https://fribyte.no) I wanted to setup my own server at home, and with some tips from friends I decided why not use an old laptop (even though it's kinda cursed to use a MacBook Air lol).

I learned tons from it and had so much fun trying out different stuff!


## 🏗️ Setup
```
OS: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS x86_64

Host: MacBook Air 7,2 1.0

CPU: Intel i5-5250U (4) @ 2.700GHz

GPU: Intel HD Graphics 6000

Memory: ~4GB
```


## 🚀 Stuff hosted on it

On Kanto I hosted a minecraft server, my Discord bot ~ "[sidBot](https://github.com/SindreKjelsrud/sidBot)", and a Wireguard VPN.
