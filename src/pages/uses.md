## What do I use?
> This page was inspired by [**Uses This**](https://usesthis.com/), and you can see more pages like this there.

The following is a list of the  different technologies that I use on a daily basis. This includes my computers, the software I run on them, how I host stuff and other miscellaneous stuff. 

I've also added the names of my machines as I think these are fun to show. The naming convention I went for was different arcs/sagas from One Piece.

## üêß Hardware (+ OS)

#### personal laptop (water7)

My primary laptop that I use for all schoolwork and personal stuff is my **14" Acer Swift 3**. It's got an i5 processor, a 1TB SSD and 8GB of RAM. I bought this back in 2020 when I managed to spill some juice over my MacBook Air which sadly "died".

As you can see in my beautiful Minecraft GRUB, the laptop is currently dualbooting Arch Linux and Windows 10. This is due to the university not always liking Linux for exams. Quite shit laptop, but it does the job.

#### gaming pc (skypiea)

For gaming and just mindless browsing at home I use a prebuilt **HP Omen 30L**. I bought this back in 2021 because my first gaming pc was kinda slowing down and I wanted the new 3080 graphics card hehe.  On the OS side it's running Windows 11 because some of the games I play unfortunately won't work on Linux.

Here is a list over some of the peripherals I use for it:

- **HyperX Alloy Origins 60.** Keyboard of choice, love the 60%.
- **Razor Ourobous.** My trustworthy mouse of 10 years!
- **Logitech C920.** Webcam for Discord and school meetings.

#### home server (eastblue)

Actually my latest addition! I bought this **HP Prodesk 600 G3 SFF** from [bergenbruktpc.no](https://bergenbruktpc.no/) on sale for around 1300NOK with an additional 16GBs of RAM. I installed ProxMox on it after quite a lot of BIOS hassle.  In short, the specs are an Intel Core i7-6700, 256GB NVME SSD, 500GB HDD & 32GB RAM.

> By the way, all the VMs on this have been named after the arcs from the East Blue saga!

I'm in the process of starting to selfhost stuff I use and different kinda services. Currently I run the following stuff on it:

- **Minecraft server:** Always gotta have one up & running. 
- **PiVPN:** The simplest way to setup and manage a VPN.
- **sidBot:** My own Discord bot ([source code](https://github.com/SindreKjelsrud/sidBot)).


#### other technology

- **iPhone 13:** Works pretty good, but thinking about switching over to FairPhone.
- Some gaming consoles:
    - **GameBoy Color:** My first mod-project, check out the [post](/blog/breathing-new-life-into-my-old-gameboy-color/) I wrote on it.
    - **Nintendo DS Lite:** Gotta have some Mario Kart on the go!
    - **Nintendo Switch:** Animal Crossing has never been cozier.
    - **Nintendo Wii:** Easily the best console for playing at home with friends.
- **Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB:** Gonna be used for my homebuilt arcade machine.
- **Sony WH-1000XM4:** Absolutely love this headset, I use it everyday.
