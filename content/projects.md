# Coding Projects

### 🤖 sidBot | A Discord bot

_Dec. 2021 - Mar. 2022, Python_  
_Dec. 2022 - Now, JavaScript_

> Github Repo: <https://github.com/SindreKjelsrud/sidBot>

- A Discord bot that responds to messages & commands with pictures and special answers depending on the message/command.
- I've made two versions, one in Python and one in JavaScript.
- Some commands get information from APIs.
  - For example, the command "!plsdog" uses this [API](https://dog.ceo/api) to show the user some cute pictures of dogs across the internet.
