## ‚úçÔ∏è Blogging
I've actually blogged quite a bit (in my opinion) this month! During the start of this exam-period I got the idea to write two posts related to a course at university, called [DAT154](https://www.hvl.no/studier/studieprogram/emne/DAT154), which is about software architecture and application development. It helped me understand different topics for the course!

I've also started journaling, as you see in this first post! I've got the idea, and a lot of inspiration, from a member ([Tim H√•rek](https://timharek.no/)) of the studentorganization ([friByte](https://fribyte.no)) I'm a part of. 

## üí™ Health
I've mostly gone bouldering and climbing, with a bit of cycling mixed into the week.  
But for the first time I've gone climbing outside, and I love it! It's so much more fun and enjoyable, and wow the views you get!

## üë®‚ÄçüíªDevelopment
During this month, I've not gotten to code as much as I'd like to, but my website will soon get the long-awaited *logs*-page where I'll store all my logs for stuff like books I've read, movies and series I've watched and so on. This way I don't need to be dependent on third-party applications! (Another inspiration from [Tim H√•rek](https://timharek.no/))

I've set up a [wiki](https://wiki.kjelsrud.dev) (or digital garden as some call it) for myself, can't wait to fill it up with info and stuff I've learned.

I've also set up a [blogsite](https://pblog.kjelsrud.dev/) for a course I'll have next semester. It's for blogging about my days at an internship during next semester where I'll learn about React, TypeScript and Redux. I'll add a blogpost later where I'll just collect everything that will be blogged during the internship into one post.

## üìö Reading
- I (finally) finished my *Steve Jobs* book this month which took forever. Pretty good book, loved to learn more about him as a person and his journey.
- Read through the manga *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood Vol. 1*. It was good, but don't know if I'll continue the series by manga (will watch the anime of course).
- Started and finished *Hjertet i to: Seks m√•neder med Karpe* in just a day. Was such a good book, loved to get to know their journey towards Spektrum x10. 

## üé¨ Entertainment
### Movies
- *Stone Locals: Rediscovering the Soul of Climbing*: This may be a new favorite movie. Wow is all I can say.
- *Fishpeople | Lives Transformed by the Sea*: I wanted to go out in the water right away after the emotional short-film.
- *Surfs Up*: Rewatch, it's so good lmao.
- *Encanto*: Very nice and emotional movie, love Disney.
- *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings*: Finally got around to watch, pretty cool film.
- *Whiplash*: Supercool film, wanted more when it ended.
### TV
- *S.W.A.T.*: Finished season 6, not a huge fan anymore tbh..
- *Star Wars: Visions*: Finished season 2, I love this concept so much. Aau's song was awesome.

## üéÆ Gaming
Not a lot of gaming this month, but I started a hardcore world in Minecraft for the first time! It's an amplified world because I wanted large mountains after I watched the last episode of Star Wars: Visions S02 - "Aau's Song".
